      <h2> About me in progress </h2>
      <p> Hello Everyone, my name is Erick Kengni, and I am a computer science
          and mathematics student at UMBC. I was first introduced to computer
          science in middle school. As a 6th grader, I was amazed by the
          intricate nature of computer scinece and how line of code could
          command the most complex machines. The duet between computer science
          and mathematics was a melody to my ears.</p>

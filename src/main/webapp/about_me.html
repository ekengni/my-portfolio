      <h2>About me in progress ... </h2>
      <p> Hello Everyone, my name is Erick Kengni, and I am a computer 
            science and mathematics student at UMBC. I was first introduced to
            computer science in middle school...
            As a 6th grader, I was amazed by the intricate nature of computer
            scinece and how line of code could command the most complex
            machines. The duet between computer science and mathematics was a 
            melody to my ears.</p>
